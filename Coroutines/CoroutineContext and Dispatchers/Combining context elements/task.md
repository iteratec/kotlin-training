# Combining context elements

It's also possible to combine different context elements. For this you can use the + operator.

For debugging the context element *CoroutineName* is usefull to change the name of the coroutine.

Change the given code and change the coroutines names to "first" and "second" and run 
the first coroutine in a default thread.
