# Playground for Kotlin training

Check out this project if you want to follow along in our Kotlin training. This is meant to be used live during our Kotlin training - not on your own. ðŸ˜‰

If you want to learn Kotlin online instead, check out the excellent [Kotlin website](https://kotlinlang.org) as well as their main tutorial, the [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html).
