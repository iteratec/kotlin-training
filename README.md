# Playground for Kotlin training

This is the Iteratec Kotlin Workshop. 

## Prerequisites

In order to execute the exercises you need Java 11 or newer. For one minor exercise you might need Node JS.

The workshop is intended for developers familiar with Java. In Kotlin, we start from 0. 

However we do not outline most of things that work exactly as in Java. For example, we do not explain what object-oriented programming is, when introducing classes in Kotlin.

## How to use this training

We recommend to use IntelliJ out of inconvenience. First build everywthing running ./gradlew build (IntelliJ might do this automatically)

Navigate to the exercises module. We have distributed the content into smaller topics. Each topic has an exercise file containg the exercises and all instructions.
The exercises can be started by starting the corresponding main-function in each file (simply click on Play-button next to the function in IntelliJ).

There is no automatic checking whether an exercise has bee solved successfully. Check your solution by examining the log output and potentially adding further log lines.
You can also compare your code with the solution folder.

Most topics contain also a theory file. These contain explanations in different wording. Using them is optional.
Exercise files normally explain and introduce new things and ideally are presented by a tutor from iteratec.

Exercises can be done out of order. However some are based on previous knowledge. Consult the exercise header to find out about the prerequisites.

Have fun :)
