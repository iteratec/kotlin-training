# CoroutineExceptionHandler

You can use a CoroutineExceptionHandler to customize the behaviour an *uncaught* exception 
is handled.

In this exercise add a CoroutineExceptionHandler to get the expected answer.

After that, try to add some child-coroutines with different CoroutineExceptionHandlers and
analyse the behaviour of the handlers.
