# Create a contravariant generic

In this task you will create a contravariant generic `Pokeball` class. Pokeball will have a single `catch(T)`
method, that catches the given Pokemon and prints a confirmation message `Caught a pokemon {pokemon}`.

Implement the `Pokeball` class, so that the `main()` function works without any modifications.
