# Create covariant generic

In this task you will create a covariant generic `Pokeball` class. Pokeball can hold a single
Pokemon and has a single method `getCaughtPokemon()` that allows to access the caught Pokemon.

Create a correct implementation of generic `Pokeball` class, so that the `main()` function
works without any modifications.
