# Terminal operators

A terminal operator is a suspend function which starts the collection of the flow values.
The most basic one we used so far is *collect*.

There are some others (we know also from collections): *toList*, *toSet*, *first*, *reduce* and *fold*.

Try to calculate the sum of all numbers by using the correct terminal operator and print the result to console.
