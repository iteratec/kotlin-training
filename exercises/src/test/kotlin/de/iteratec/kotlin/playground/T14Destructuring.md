# Destructuring

## Basic syntax

Some types support destructuring. Instances of this type can be destructured into one or more components using positional matching and the curvy bracket notation.

```kotlin
val (firstPropertyOfDataClass, secondPropertyOfDataClass, ...) = myInstanceOfTheDataClass // Will declare and initialize several variables at once
myMap.forEach { (key, value) -> println("Key $key is mapped to $value")} // forEach expects a lambda with one argument of type MapEntry
val (firstElementOfList) = myListInstance
```

## Provide a type with destructuring

A function "componentN" marked with the <b> operator </b> keyword defines the N-th element generated by destructuring 

```kotlin
operator fun component1(): ReturnType {
    // implementation
}
```
