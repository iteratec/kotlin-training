## Todo

* Define a structure for basic and advanced training modules.
  Idea is to have lessons for both trainings in modules to create individual trainings if necessary
* Use the Academy Plugin for the tasks and lessons of the basic training. Transfer the tasks step by step.
* Transer the kotlin advanced lessons into the new structure
* Clarify the usage of **edu** Tasks and how to define tests for the course participants.
* Polish the current lessons
