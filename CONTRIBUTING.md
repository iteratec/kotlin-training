## Todo

* Define a structure for basic and advanced training modules.
  Idea is to have lessons for both trainings in modules to create individual trainings if necessary.
* Use the Academy Plugin for the tasks and lessons of the basic training. Transfer the tasks step by step.
* Transer the kotlin advanced lessons into the new structure
* Remove the content of the remote repos kotlin-basic and kotlin-advanced when the transfer is done.
  * Remove the directories
  * Remove the remote repos in the git config
* Clarify the usage of **edu** Tasks and how to define tests for the course participants.
* Polish the current lessons.
